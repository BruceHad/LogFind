  * Allow the use of Regular Expressions to define file names.
  * Throw error is .logfind file isn't available.
* ~~Parse search arguments like "logfind [-o] string [string ...] using argparse~~
* ~~Default search behaviour - files that contain all search strings.~~
* ~~OR search behaviour (-o modifier) - files that contain any of the search strings.~~
* Add unit tests.
